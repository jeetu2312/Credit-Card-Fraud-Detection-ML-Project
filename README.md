# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-ML-Project
In this project, I am using a dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, I am going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.
In this project, I will build and deploy the following two machine learning algorithms: 
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) 
Isolation Forest Algorithm Furthermore
Using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-scores, I will investigate why the classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading. 
In addition, I will explore the use of data visualization techniques common in data science, such as parameter histograms and correlation matrices, to gain a better understanding of the underlying distribution of data in my data set.
